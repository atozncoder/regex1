Additional Information and Resources

You are an employee at EtherCloud, a web hosting company. There has been a push to migrate all internal documentation to Latex, and it has fallen to you to convert some files. A few files in particular are oddly formatted. Using a sed script and the provided example file, mail-forwarding.txt, create a script that completes the following tasks:

    Add the following to the top of the document:

      \documentclass{article}
      \usepackage{hyperref}
      \begin{document}

    Encase the first line in a /title{NAME} tag
    Convert all sections starting with Roman numerals to use \section{NAME}; do not keep the Roman numerals (Roman numerals use the following letters: I V X L C D M
    Encase all lines starting with [root@red-hat ~]# in code blocks (\begin{verbatim} and \end{verbatim}; note that the ~ can be alternate text
        There are some instances where two lines start with [root@red-hat ~]# immediately after one another; use sed's N functionality to write this portion of the script
    Any lines beginning with four spaces or a tab should be contained in code blocks; it is acceptable for each line to have its own code block tags since each line in a different setting
    Format any file names ending with .cf to use /texttt{TEXT} tags
    Change anything encased in backtics to use /texttt{TEXT} tags
    At the end of the document add \end{document}; this can be done by using $ a <APPENDED TEXT>

Save the script as latex.sed and the converted file as mail-forwarding.txt.


following is the latex.sed:

#! /usr/bin/sed

1s/(.+)/\\documentclass{article}\n\\usepackage{hyperref}\n\\begin{document}\n\\title{\1}/
s/^[IVXLDCM]+\. (.+)/\\section{\1}/
/\[root@red-hat.+?\]#/ {
  N
  s/(\[root@red-hat.+?\]#.+(\n\[root@red-hat.+?\]#.+)?)/\\begin{verbatim}\n\1\n\\end{verbatim}/
}
s/(\t|    )(.+)/\\begin{verbatim}\n\2\n\\end{verbatim}/
s/(\b\w+\.cf\b)/texttt{\1}/g
s/`(.+?)`/\\texttt{\1}/g
$ a \\\end{document}



Run it:

sed -E -f latex.sed mail-forwarding.txt > mail-forwarding.latex
