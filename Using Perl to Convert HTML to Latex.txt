EtherCloud's internal documentation system is no longer working! As the web hosting company grows, keeping documentation in a self-maintained website is no longer working. Instead, it's been requested that documents are written in Latex so they can be added to a proper documentation repository. The only problem is what to do with the existing documents. By using the provided regex cheat sheet document, craft a Perl script to convert all existing HTML documents to Latex.

If you're unfamiliar with Latex, use the following table to determine how to precede:
HTML Tag 	Latex
H1 	\title{TITLE}
H2 	\section{SECTIONNAME}
H3 	\subsection{SECTIONNAME}
Unordered Lists 	\begin{itemize} AND \end{itemize}
List items 	\item
Italics 	\textit{TEXT}
Inline code 	texttt{TEXT}
Code blocks 	\begin{verbatim} AND \end{verbatim}

Additionally, all documents must start with:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{hyperref}
\begin{document}

And end with:

\end{document}

Note that if you're having trouble getting any backslashes to show up in your output, use two backslashes in its place (i.e., s/<ul>/\\begin{itemize}/).

Save the script as html-to-latex.pl. Run it against the regexcs.html file and save the resulting output as regexcs.latex.
